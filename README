URI::ImpliedBase 

This class was created to provide support in SOAP::Lite for relative URLS
in WSDL.

It acts as a wrapper around URI; it adds an additional level of processing 
before the URI makes in into the URI class. This additional code looks at the 
incoming URI: if it is absolute, it saves the scheme and path as the current 
base. If it isn't, it creates and saves a new base URI internally, using the 
current working directory as the path and "file:" as the scheme. Any relative
URIs supplied thereafter are silently converted to use the new base.

Questions, bugs, and problems should be sent to me at mcmahon@ibiblio.org.
I can't guarantee to address them in a timely manner, but I always read my 
mail!
